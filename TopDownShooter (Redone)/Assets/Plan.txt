# GAME PLAN

### Main Menu

- Try to load data from the player
- If new player then have **New Game**, **Options**, **Exit Game**. Otherwise, have **Continue**
- If click **New Game**, then load

### Tutorial

- Introduce player to movement and aiming
- Introduce weapon switching
- Introduce abilities (like dash)

### Game Scene

- Start playing straight away as soon as load
- Spawn Enemies in waves
- Difficulty proportional to players level
    - Could have level limits to which enemies spawn (no enemy 2 until level 20…)
    - Then when unlocked, percentage spawn rate increases with level increment (enemy 2 spawn rate = 0.1 * level)
    - Enemies will have different stats
        - randomly assigned based on level they are
        - each enemy will be same level as player
    - A side screen or dropdown from the top showing the levels of each enemy in this run and stats range (Enemy 1: Health: 200 - 600) (since its randomly assigned

### Shooting

- maybe a bar on the screen somewhere to showcase the clip size, if it gets full then lock shooting (”reload”) until bar fills up - WEAPON OVERHEAT, when bar is full, goes red then decreases, cant shoot until its zero
- Maybe a Clip Counter next to crosshair showing size of the clip, and how many bullets are ‘inactive’
    - Can have a counter which gets updated via the projectile script ‘onEnable’ ‘onDisable’
- Damage counter when hit enemy or get hit
- Flash when hit

### Score

- Have a scoring system which counts:
    - score per (timer)
    - score per kill
    - Score per bullet fired
    - score per ability used
    - Bonus score for completing a wave
- At then end, display all scores on a screen and then the total score
- Score = Experience / 10

### Leveling Up

- Each level player receives 1 Talent Point
- Every 5 levels player receives 2 Talent points

# SAVING AND LOADING UPGRADES

Players Spent talent points will go into a seperate list<>:

`PlayerHealthPointsSpentList<>`

`PlayerDefencePointsSpentList<>`

`PlayerAgilityPointsSpentList<>`

Then have a list for both weapons and both bullets:

`WeaponRiflePointsSpentList<>`

`WeaponShotgunPointsSpentList<>`

`BulletRiflePointsSpentList<>`

`BulletShotgunPointsSpentList<>`

## Player Stats

WHEN SPENDING TALENT POINTS, SAVE VALUES IN A SEPERATE LIST, stated above

## Weapon and Bullet Stats

Each scriptable weapon and bullet will have its own base stats and multipliers.

### Loading Default Stats

- `Weapon Controller` has a function which adds selected weapon stats to the `WeaponStatsManager.Instance`
- `Bullet Controller` has a function which adds selected weapon stats to the `BulletStatsManager.Instance`

### Loading Upgraded Stats

- `Weapon Controller` has another function which gets called afterwards
    - This will get the points spent list for the corresponding weapon/bullet
    - multiply those values by the multipliers found in the scriptable object
    - update the StatsManager.Instance values again
